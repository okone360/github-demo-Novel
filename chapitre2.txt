turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily 
closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.
My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle-western city for three generations. 
The Carraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that we're descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, 
but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War
 and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today.
I never saw this great-uncle but I'm supposed to look like him—with special reference to the rather 
hard-boiled painting that hangs in Father's office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century 
after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the 
counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like
 the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go east and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business so 
 I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep-school for me and finally said, "Why—ye-es" with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year
  and after various delays I came east, Catsby, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.
